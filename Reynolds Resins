 has been painting since the 1970's, and specializes in landscapes and wildlife. His years of painting shows in each stroke of his brush. He paints in acrylic and oil based paints on canvas or slate. He also creates hand crafted arrowheads, and knives made with deer antlers. These knives are done traditionally, as the Native people had done themselves and are great display items and conversation starters. James puts his all in everything he does.
